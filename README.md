# Masa mod downloader

Okay so i made this in 5 minutes there is probably some way to break this. 
First of all I wanna say shout out to masa for adding this json file to his
site, it allowed me to package this for the AUR as well which has been 
quite nice to use. Second of all please ** DO NOT ** go to masa for help
with this script. Finally, this is linux only.

### Usage:

```bash
./download.sh <mod name> <game version> <mod loader>
```
